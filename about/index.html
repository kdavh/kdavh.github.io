<div id="about">
  <div class="indent-paragraph">
    <p>I am excited to work for a company that tackles challenging and interesting problems, has a communicative, healthy environment, and wants their employees always improving.  I hope to focus my work on Javascript and Ruby and expand into new languages and frameworks.  I'm currently dabbling with Golang and delving deep into Backbone.</p>

    <p>More than four years ago, I started studying web development on my own.  I completed <a href="http://appacademy.io" target="_blank">App Academy</a> to accelerate my learning.</p>

    <p>I've been working professionally as a software engineer for a few years and love it.  I learn massive amounts every day, and advancing to the top of this field is my goal.</p>
