<div id="about">
  <div class="indent-paragraph">
    <p>A few years ago, I started studying web development on my own.  I completed <a href="http://appacademy.io" target="_blank">App Academy</a> to accelerate my learning and have now come into my own.</p>

    <p>I am excited to work for a company that tackles challenging and interesting problems, has a communicative, healthy environment, and wants their employees always improving.  I hope to focus my near term work on Javascript and Rails and continue improving towards true expertise.</p>
