  <p>A word finder game.  Each round, the player is given a set amount of time to find as many words from the jumble of letters at the top as they can.  Designed for desktop as well as mobile devices.</p>
  <p>The real goal of this game is to be second language vocab practice.  The found words can be selected to see their translation into another language.</p>
